# True Sight

üìù [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) extension providing auditors with collaborative documentation capabilities.

## Features

This extension provides a way for auditors to **document HTTP messages** as well as quality-of-life enhancements to facilitate the reverse-engineering process such as **workflows** and **variable name substitutions**.

When running on a non-temporary project, the extension saves its data as JSON text files. This lets version control systems such as Git easily keep track of changes and thus provides a way for auditors to **share and collaborate on projects**.
